     		<p>Great things are happening at the Revolutionary Notion Organization. In 2019 we had not many people willing 
		   to help in providing education for our fellow Liberian brothers and sisters who are not financially strong 
 		   enough to attend computer literate schools. Over the past years, we currently have twenty (20) industrious 
	           youg people including both genders who are working immensely our young generation can not grow up and have
		   no ideas on how to use computers as we all know we are heading into a virtual world.</p>

    		<p>Our commitment is to providing exceptional client services and to living the core values of this organization
		   to the fullest with dedication to enhancing the educational, physical, emotional and intellectual health wellness
		   of our young people. This organizattion stands to maintain it's excellence in leadershipp, integrity, full transparency
		   in the spirit of the community coollaboration. looking ahead, we are focused on accelerating our growth strategy while
		   continuing to build the young generation. We are excited about our expansion plans for our current programs. For now we are currently basing in Montserrado County; hopefully by the end of 2021, this organization will be decentralized in additional two 
                   counties i.e.Margibi and Grand Bassa County.</p>
